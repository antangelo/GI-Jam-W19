# GI-Jam-W19

This is a project made across during the Global Game Jam.

## Building
This project require LibGDX with the box2d physics engine.
It also requires a controller to be played in its current state 
(The game was designed using a PlayStation 4 controller).

The game was built and tested on the desktop platform. 
It's unlikely to work on Android or iOS. 
There's a chance it might build and run in browser but I wouldn't count on it.
